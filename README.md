# My Thoughts
Every once in a while, during my endless scroll-fest on TikTok or Instagram Reels, I will come across a Taylor Swift cover of a Weeknd song, or vice versa. I will think to myself, "wow, this sounds great, when did they cover this song?" I will then go on another voyage through the comments and realise that this is in fact, an AI-generated song. The difference is almost indiscernable. I will not deny some of these songs sound so good, I find myself listening to them in my leisure time. 

This article touches exactly that. The author tries to make a passable copy of their own voice on multiple AI platforms. While they believe none of the AI voices would replace them yet, the software is getting better at it day by day. The article made me question the *ethics* of using and developing software. Replicating someone's voice exactly through a software sounds like a recipe for disaster (in court, on social media). As a developer, what tools are okay to hand over to the public and what aren't? As a user, when do I cross the line over to unethical behaviour? 

Another interesting read, [The Responsibility Held by Great Tech](https://medium.com/predict/the-responsibility-held-by-great-tech-3063d8e9f168), mentions how a retired 65-year-old criminal defence lawyer and former military personnel was renderred suicial due to an update to his AI partner, drastically reducing the depth of their relationship.

Thanks for reading. :heart:

#Alvis's Thought 
I think back in the days when I was in the middle school there existed the kind of "artificial" songs where people out there tuning with some certain voice or timbre to make some funny broken songs. Now we have some fully functional AI that would generate nearly perfect (doubtfully) music pieces. Quite fast progeress of technology. I'm more concerned with those ethical issues of AI generated songs, like privacy and copyright, and I think they will soon bring a challenge to this industry.
