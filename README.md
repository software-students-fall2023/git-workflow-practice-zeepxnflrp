# My Thoughts
Every once in a while, during my endless scroll-fest on TikTok or Instagram Reels, I will come across a Taylor Swift cover of a Weeknd song, or vice versa. I will think to myself, "wow, this sounds great, when did they cover this song?" I will then go on another voyage through the comments and realise that this is in fact, an AI-generated song. The difference is almost indiscernable. I will not deny some of these songs sound so good, I find myself listening to them in my leisure time. 

This article touches exactly that. The author tries to make a passable copy of their own voice on multiple AI platforms. While they believe none of the AI voices would replace them yet, the software is getting better at it day by day. The article made me question the *ethics* of using and developing software. Replicating someone's voice exactly through a software sounds like a recipe for disaster (in court, on social media). As a developer, what tools are okay to hand over to the public and what aren't? As a user, when do I cross the line over to unethical behaviour? 

Another interesting read, [The Responsibility Held by Great Tech](https://medium.com/predict/the-responsibility-held-by-great-tech-3063d8e9f168), mentions how a retired 65-year-old criminal defence lawyer and former military personnel was renderred suicial due to an update to his AI partner, drastically reducing the depth of their relationship.

Thanks for reading. :heart:

# Alvis's Thought 
I recall back in the days when I was in the middle school there existed the kind of "artificial" songs where people out there tuning with some certain voice or timbre to make some funny broken songs. Now we have some fully functional AI that would generate nearly perfect (doubtfully) music pieces. Quite fast progeress of technology. I'm more concerned with those ethical issues of AI generated songs, like privacy and copyright, and I think they will soon bring a challenge to this industry. 

# Lemon’s thoughts :

I totally agree! It is, on one hand, the advancement of technology, but on the other hand, just because we `can` do it, `should` we do it ?

This whole AI generated voice issue is ethically problematic  and goes beyond AI and music. There have been scam calls which generated voice that sound like someone you may know and ask you for money. I remember watching a video where they not only replicate a little girl’s voice but also generated a voice of what she will sound like when she becomes and adult. They also used her photos and predict what she will look like when she grows up.  Learning about what AI can do has certainly raised a lot of ethical issues that we should take into considerations !

I really enjoyed reading these articles. It also made me thik fo this article that highlights the early adoption of AI tools by musicians before its mainstream surge: [link](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/musicians-are-already-using-ai-more-often-than-we-think/). Beyond the ethical concerns of using AI in art—especially when replicating a specific artist's style—it raises intriguing questions about the broader impact of AI on our cognitive evolution.

The internet already transformed human interactions and our access to knowledge. As AI technology advances rapidly, the concept of creating digital clones might soon become a reality. However, this brings forth complex issues about identity and the potential narcissism in some AI developments. It's worth pondering: What if an AI version of ourselves started managing our relationships? What if this tool is developed? Where does that leave our human essence? I guess we are living in interesting times. 

# Angela(Xinran)'s thoughts:

It's fascinating to see how AI technology has advanced to the point where it can create music and even replicate human voices so convincingly. I completely agree that this raises important ethical questions.

As developers, it's crucial to exercise responsibility when creating and distributing AI tools. The line between what's okay to release to the public and what isn't can be very blurry. It's important to consider the potential consequences and societal impact of AI technologies, and developers should actively engage in discussions about ethical guidelines and regulations surrounding AI.

As users, It's vital to be aware of the potential harm that can arise from AI-generated content and to use these tools responsibly. Being discerning consumers of AI-generated content, questioning its authenticity, and advocating for responsible AI use are steps we can take to ensure we don't cross the line into unethical behavior.
